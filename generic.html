<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">General</a></h2>
<p>The content of this website is intended to help new team members understand
the direction of our team.</p>
<p>It also helps novice and advance beginners by providing a set of simple rules.
Anyone should read this as best practice and provide feedback in case
something is wrong.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rule #1: Keep it DRY! Don't repeat yourself!</li>
<li>Rule #2: KISS - Keep it simple, stupid simple!</li>
<li>All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no
matter how many people contributed.</li>
<li>No single person is responsible for a part of the code. We write code
together, we take the blame together, we take the glory together.
Once a code was approved for review, reviewers are also responsible for
that code.</li>
<li>Write all code as it will be written once and read thousand times.
Write code for maximum readability.</li>
<li>When you need a trade-off between readability and code duplication, choose
to have a code less readable but without duplication.</li>
<li>Write code as it will be used by humans, not a machine. You are not a
a compiler / interpretor.</li>
<li>Optimization should come second and only if really needed. Don't Use clever
tricks and other optimization to early.</li>
<li>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work and do it well.
Always work on the story you have, not something you think we're going to
need sometime in the future.
Don't try implement all usecases you can think of and end with poorly
designed code and poorly tested code.</li>
<li>Try to keep methods as flat as possible and return as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Don't use abbreviation. Use full, meaningful names.</li>
<li>Don't use tabs for indentation, and in general don't use tabs for anything
else. The only exceptions are the Makefiles.</li>
<li>Favor indentation using 4 spaces. For deep nested languages (HTML, JS) it
is OK to use 2 spaces.</li>
<li>Maximum line length is 78 characters.</li>
<li>Don't mix multiple languages in a single file.</li>
<li>No need for the ultimate purism, when using / calling code from external
libraries it is OK if those calls don't comply with coding convention.</li>
<li>When extending external libraries use the coding convention used by that
library. It might be harder to define the border of those changes but this
should help with sending patches upstream.</li>
<li>When reporting a code related problem, use
<a class="reference external" href="http://sscce.org">Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Each repository / project will have a README file describing why it exists
and what it should do.
The README should also include notes about contributing to the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Each repository will have a LICENSE and AUTHORS files.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Technical dept comments (ex FIXME, TODO) will always have an attached
ticket ID and will use the following format. Only <strong>FIXME</strong> marker is used
followed by ticket ID. Comments will come on a new lines.
Adapt this to the style of comments use in the specific language, but
is important to keep the <strong>FIXME:123:</strong> marker.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# FIXME:1234:
# Details about this tech-dept. Ex: Can only be fixed when full moon.
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Words are an important part of how software works.
Even though there may be dozens of people creating a product, reading
comments, documentation, notes etc, it should still sound like we speak
in one consistent voice.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When writing text for the documentation or text that appears in the
program favour classy over cute or mechanical.
Respect the reader, act more like a human and less like a computer,
and use fewer words:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Instead of:

Successfully deleted the #{branch_name} branch.

Try something like:

The #{branch_name} branch has been deleted.
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use a graphical commit tool (<tt class="docutils literal">git gui</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">gitg</tt>) for doing the commit.
In this way you can split the changes in multiple commits and you can also
do a first review just before the commit.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When you don't understand something related to security, don't just walk
by and ignore it. Try to understand what is happening there, or ask
someone else to take a look or to explain it to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Don't abuse inheritance and favour composition and delegation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Write code so that it can be read / used by developers having a work
style different than yours. Don't add IDE / text editor specific things
Don't assume that other developer will use the same IDE / text editor,
fancy keyboard (or foot pedals), array of huge monitors...</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When you have a non-trivial conditional expression (logical condition from
an if statement), break it in smaller sub-conditionals.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Comments</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">All comments should be valid sentences and should end with a full stop (.).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Try to write code so that it speak for itself and so that a comment is not
required.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Try to name variables, methods, function so that they communicate their
intend. A comment is only attached to the place where the name is defined,
and not present in all other multiple places where it is used. IDE can help,
but we should not rely on that.</p>
<p>When a comment is required is like saying: I have no idea for a better name
for this thing, so here is my poor comment. Good luck with figuring the
intend of this name when you see the it in the rest of this file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe
components, how they work, their limitations, and the way they are
constructed. Don't leave others in the team guessing as to the purpose
of uncommon or non-obvious code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Place comments on a new line above their subject.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Avoid end of line comments. End of line comments can be used for lint
ignores and other hints for automated tools... but not for humans.</p>

<div class="section" id="exceptions-handling">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Exceptions handling</a></h2>
<p>Here are some simple generic rules for working with exceptions.</p>
<p>In Chevah project we use 2 major &quot;kinds&quot; of exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>Errors</cite> are top level exceptions that are not going to be handled
internally by the package / library.</li>
<li><cite>Exceptions</cite> normal exceptions, passed inside the package/library to signal
various conditions. The public API for the package/library should not raise
this kind of exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions can take any format, and most of the time they can contain only
a text with some details about the error. These exceptions are low level
and should be raised in simple conditions.</p>
<p>Errors should have an unique ID and a data attribute.
Each ID should be raised from a single place.
The data attribute is a dictionary with key / values that make sense for the
error.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-specific">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Project specific</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each log message should be documented, listing format, introduction version,
version since it was obsolete, log type, conditions in which it is raised
and other informations that can be useful for users.</li>
<li>A logging messages should only be called from a single place in the code.
This will greatly help with support and debugging.</li>
<li>A logging message should have a unique ID. This will help the support team
by pointing a specific event. It will also help when localized logs are
used.</li>
<li>If a logging message should be issued from multiple places, move the
logging call into a dedicated helper method. This will help with
automatic detection of accidentally using same message ID for different
logs.</li>
<li>Components should not issue logging messages that are outside of
theirs scope, but rather use exceptions to pass the log informations.</li>
<li>If there are no other options, rather than directly issuing a logging
message, the component should call a function located in the component
that 'owns' the log ID that will issue the log.</li>
<li>All branches will need to use the following convention:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TICKETNO-SHORT_DESCRIPTION</span></tt>. By having a reference to a ticket, it will
be much easier to track and keep a record of branch purpose and its
development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
447-add_sqlite_log
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each user configuration options should be documented,
listing valid values, place where the configuration is located,
introduction version, version since it was obsolete,
together with a description of the purpose and effect.</li>
<li>Configuration options will be documented using the following format. Please
note the order in which fields are defined, the name of the files and the
format for declaring possible values. All fields should be present, and
if no value is defined, use 'None' or leave it blank.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
