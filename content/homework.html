General

This page tries to by the "styleguide" for your life :)

Working in a distributed team can be fun, challenging but can also make you
sick.

A distributed teams means that it is scattered across different locations,
and everyone works wherever they are. People can work from home
(bedroom, living room or home office room), from coworking places or
any place they feel comfortable.

If you have always do your job "at work", the transition can be rough. 
Working remotely isn’t for everyone, and it can take a while to adjust to it.
Ask for advice from your team members, they have also been
through this and can share their experience.


You are in control
==================

When you work in a distributed team, you are in control.
You plan your schedule and decide where and when to work.

Most difficult part is to find the motivation to work. Hopefully you enjoy
what you do at work and genuinely care about getting work done for the
project. Otherwise you might need to find another project or recognize that
distributed teams are not your style.

There is nobody to tell you when to work, how to work or to check that you
are at work. It is your own style to work and you need to find ways to
improve the way you work.


Stay focus on what you do
=========================

Try not to mix "at work" activities with "after work" activities.
Make a clear distinction between when you are "at work" an when not.
Otherwise you might be working or slacking non-stop.

When you are "at work", it does not matter how much time you spend sitting at
your desk or staring at the screen.
The only thing you have to show for your day is that you’ve actually got
something done.

Define a time when work and place where you work.
Let others know that these boundaries.
When at home, other members of the house might find it hard that even if
though you’re around, you’re actually “at the office” working.

Same boundaries applied when you are not at work or on leave/holiday.
Refrain from checking work email, colleagues progress or project status.
Take that time to disconnect from work, recharge your energy and motivation, interact with your friends... just do something else.


Staying Healthy Is Harder
=========================

Staying healthy, both physical and mental, is harder when you are on your
own.

When you work from home or bedroom you tend to do little physical
effort. Fitness is something you have to pay close attention.

Make sure you have a comfortable desk, chair, keyboard,
mouse and monitor. Any of these can cause pains.
There is also the option of working from a standing desk.

Being alone at work is probably the hardest part.
When you work from home, the only person you talk to all day are members of
the house. I can get pretty sad.

Disconnect yourself from the work, stay away from the screen and feel
more like a social human being.
Be pro-active and invite friend for lunch, coffee, dinner,
game night, pasta night, drinks.
You shouldn’t be dependent on work for social interactions.


Communication
=============

Use "away" and "busy" functionality of you instant messaging tool let other
know about your status.

When you talk to someone face-to-face or voice-to-voice,
you get a lot of contextual information and unspoken messages,
and information is exchanged pretty quickly.

Always acknowledge that you have received and understood a text message.

Since most of the communication is done using text, get proficient at typing.
You will write many code, emails, documents, text chats.

The process of writing things down should encourage you to slow down,
organize and clarify your thoughts before sharing them with someone else.

When things get to complicated, don't hesitate to switch to voice chat, but
after a voice chat don't forget to document what was discussed by updating
a document, a ticket or creating new tickets with follow up tasks.

Document everything in public places.
Folks can look up the information they need to see how a project’s going, and someone can quickly step in when a colleague is out on vacation.

Ever forget what was discussed at a meeting? Or, what a client talked to you about?
It’s essential to write everything down to share with your colleagues.
