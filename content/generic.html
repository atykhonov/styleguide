General
=======

* All comments should be valid sentences and should end with a full stop (.).

* Don't use abbreviation. Use full, meaningful names.

* Don't use tabs for indentation, and in general don't use tabs for anything else. The only exceptions are the Makefiles.

* Indent using 4 spaces.

* Maximum line length is 78 characters. This will allow quoting code without exceeding 80 characters length.

* A logging messages should only be called from a single place.
  This will avoid creating conflicts between logging messages.

  * If a logging message should be issued from multiple places, move the
    logging call into a dedicated method

  * Components should not issue logging messages that are outside of
    theirs scope, but rather use exceptions to pass the log informations.

  * If there are no other options, rather than directly issuing a logging
    message, the component should call a function located in the component
    that 'owns' the log ID that will issue the log.

* All branches will need to use the following convention: 
  ``TICKETNO-SHORT_DESCRIPTION``. By having a reference to a ticket, it will
  be much easier to track and keep a record of branch purpose and its
  development. 

Example::

    447-add_sqlite_log


Merge commit message
====================

We would like to have a clean commit log on the main development branch.

We plan to use merge commit messages  to create the changelog/release notes
which are published to the user community. By spending an extra minute
crafting a good message, you can help the creator of the release notes
in getting a better job, faster.

This is why a merge should have a standard commit message, in the format::

   [#1234][type] Summary of changes for this branch
   
    * Description of a subchange, and in case it is longer
     should span across multiple lines
    * Description of another subchange.

Below is a description for each field:

 * #1234 is the ticket number for this branch. It is used to get more details about branch work and review. 

 * then comes the ticket type.

   * It is imporant for the changelog as some customers will only care about security changes.
   * If we don't want to have this message in the changelog files, set the type to **task**.
   * Here are the available types: 

     * feature - new features added to the products.
     * defect - fixing existing features.
     * security - security fixes of existing features.
     * task - changes that should not appear in the changelog.

 * The branch summary should be on a single line and should be under 50 characters.

 * The branch description starts with an empty line and then it can contain any valid RST code. It is recommended to keep the content as a list.

  * Writing Good PQM Messages

    * Describe what impact the change will have on users. What will the users notice?

      * "Users now can X"
      * "It is no longer possible to do Y"
      * "The text on the ABC form is now Z" (e.g. "reworded to be gender neutral")

    * If the above isn't clear enough for "Joe User" to understand, explaining the background to the change can be helpful, by adding in "Previously, X used to do Y". For example:

     * "Previously, users were unable to upload files to a folder if they had write permissions."


Small Merge Requests
====================

We would like to have many small merge requests, because the bigger they get, the more costly they are - now and in the future.

One merge request should do one thing only.

Feel free to submit as many merge request as you can. We have a problem with the size of a merge request, not with their number :)

Some reasons for keeping the merge requests small:

 * Large patches are much more likely to do many things
 * It's harder to understand them
 * It's harder to review them
 * It's harder to inspect the main branch to find the merge that introduced a bug
 * It's more likely to break the build
 * It's harder to cherry pick code for backporting / supporting old releases
