General
=======

* Variable declarations must start with 'var'.

* Do your best to never use a semicolon.
  This means avoiding them at line breaks and avoiding multi-statement lines.
  Semi-colon at the end of the line is added only when required.

* Use 2 space identation.

* Variable, function, method and constants name are after PEP8.
  variable_name, function_name, methodName, ClassName, CONSTANT_NAME

* Callback methods should always end with 'Callback' as the
  method/function name. This is a remender of the fact that
  the context is lost.

* use ``===`` instead of ``==`` for comparison. ``===`` doesn't do type
  coercion.

* Only use ``typeof`` for checking against undefined variables::

    typeof foo !== 'undefined'

* For all other type checking use the custom defined typeOf() function.

* Try to avoid the usage of ``instanceof`` and don't use it for native types.

* Create new arrays using the array literals ``[]`` notation. Don't use
  ``new Array()``.

* Iterate arrays using the classic ``for`` loop::

    var list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...... 100000000];
    for (var i = 0, l = list.length; i == l; i++) {
        console.log(list[i]);
    }

* Always define the variable used to iterate in a ``for`` loop.

* Don't use ``eval`` and don't pass strings to ``setTimeout`` and
  ``setInterval``.

* Use ``undefined`` instead of the the traditional ``null``.

* Keep braces on the same line as their corresponding statements. Never omit
  them for single-line if / else statements::

    if (something) {
        // code here
    } else {
        // code here
    }

    function duppy() {
        var something
        return {
            foo: function() {} 
        }
    }

* Avoid using leading paranthesis

* Avoid using ``delete`` operator and only use it to delete explicitly
  set properties on normal objects::

    var obj = {x: 1};
    obj.y = 2;
    delete obj.x;  // true
    delete obj.y;  // true

* Use single quote for strings.

Example::

    In HTML, we use " as quotes around attribute values, like this:

    <a href="foo">bar</a>
    In JavaScript, we use ' as much as possible.

    alert('qux');
    This way, we can use consistent quotes when writing HTML inside of JS:

    alert('<a href="foo">bar</a>')

* REST web services should always return a valid dictionary
  and not an Array or a primitive. JSON-RPC is forced to return a dictionary
  by the protocol.

* Callbacks called from the GUI / DOM should be prefixed with `on`.
  Ex: onAuthentication (when authenitcate button is pressed),
  onLogout (when logout link is pressed),
  onLoginFormSubmit (when login form is submitted)

* Callbacks/Errback for XHR are be prefixed with `cb` and `eb`, similar
  with Python/Twisted convention.

CSS interaction
===============


JS related CSS class
--------------------

Try to append js- to all javascript-based selectors. This is taken from
`slightly obtrusive javascript`_. The idea is that you should be able to tell
a presentational class from a functional class.

There are good things and bad things about "Unobtrustive JavaScript."
One bad thing: it's hard to tell what JavaScript is touching an element.

Only ever use classes and ids prefix with js- when touching the DOM with
JavaScript.

For example::

    <a href="#prices" class="button js-open-tab">Prices</a>

Now we know to look for any JavaScript touching .js-open-tab, which should
only be a simple search away.

And hey, now JavaScript and CSS won't share selectors. Since we're separating
our content and presentation, we might as well separate our behavior all the
way too.

Changing CSS/HTML from JS
-------------------------

Don't modify the associated CSS properties, but rather modify the CSS class::

   GOOD: $('#element_id').addClass('highlight');
   BAD : $('#element_id').css('font-weight': 'bold');

Same story as with CSS, don't modify HTML tag attributes,
but rather try to change the CSS class::

    GOOD: $('#element_id').addClass('sprite red_dot');
    BAD : $('#element_id').attr('src': 'some/red_dot.png');


Test styleguide
===============

* We use ``assert`` style testing using the same syntax as in Python unit
  tests.
* Leave 2 emtpy lines before each ``suite`` and one empty line before each
  ``test``

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    /*
    Tests for login controller.
    */


    suite('LoginCtrl', function() {

      // Shared variables.
      var scope
      var ctrl

      setup(function() {
        // Initialize first.
      })

      teardown(function() {
        // Clean second.
      })

      test(
      'Initializes with no errors and blank values' +
      'long line are wrapped',
      function() {
        var something = Something()

        something.doSomething()

        assert.equal('', something.username)
      })


      suite('critical_error attribute', function(){

        test(
        'When set, hides the form and sets the error message.',
        function(){
        var message = manu.makeUniqueString()

          scope.critical_error = message
          scope.$digest()

          assert.isFalse(scope.show_form)
          assert.equal(message, scope.alert.error)
        })

      })
