This pages described the style guides / coding conventions used for the
Chevah project.

We hope that by following these guide you will make it easier to collaborate
with others.

There is a page with common rules and a special page for each language
or technology used by the project.

Please note that these guides are continuously updated according to latest
best practices.

If you have any comment or suggestions, please get in touch with us.

We try to automatically check these rules using `pocket-lint`_.
