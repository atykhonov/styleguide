General
=======

* For python we have pocket-lint that checks for PEP8 and some other things.

* `Python PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ 
  **Python base code style guide**.

* Lines with 78 characters.

* When adding pylint exception, always add a comment explaining the reason why the exception was added

* Use named parameters for calling methods. This will reduce future refactoring effort.

* If a method or class initialization/constructor method has more than 1 argument always use named parameters for calling that method.

* Strings are in single quotes. This will make it easier to generated quoted
  text for UI or HTML.

YES::

    other_var = 'string'
    some_var = 'string "b" yes'

NO::

    other_bad = "string"
    some_bad = "string 'b' yes"


Project specific
================


Imports
-------

* Imports should be called at the start of each module, the only exception is
  allowd for avoiding circular imports.

* There is one empty line between the import block and module comment.

* The imports blocks are separated by one empty line.

* They will be arranged in 3 major blocks:

  * The first one is for importing from Python standard modules.
  * The second from modules outside of the project.
  * The last for modules belonging to the project.

* Chevah projects have a 'chevah.common' package which will be imported first
  in the list of project modules.

* The ``from __future__ import with_statement`` and
  ``from chevah.commons import __future__`` will be placed on top of the
  file, just after the module comment, with a space. It will be the first
  import from the standard library.

* In each block the modules are sorted in alphabetical order, case-insensitive.

* When importing multiple members of a module, if the don't exceed the 78
  characters limit, they will be listed on the same line

* When importing multiple members of a module, and they exceed the 78
  characters limit, they will be listed as a list, with each member on a
  line ending with comma.
