who requests a reviewer and a person who checks a review.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>The goal of a review is to eliminate as many defects as possible,
regardless of who &quot;caused&quot; the error. Branch driver and reviews work
together to achieve this goal.</li>
<li>The review process is a very efficient form of pair-programming.</li>
<li>Branch driver is the person (or persons) requesting the review and
responsible for implementing changes during review.</li>
<li>Reviewer is the person responsible for checking the code or changes.</li>
<li>The review process is first class citizen of the Quality Assurance process.</li>
<li>Each defect found during a review is an opportunity to improve the code.
Every defect found and fixed in peer review is a defect that a customer
never sees and another problem that support doesn't have to spend time
tracking down.</li>
<li>The branch driver is responsible for getting his/her branch approved. In
case a branch review is delayed, the branch driver should contact the
reviewers and urge the review.</li>
<li>While the main purpose of a review is to assert the quality of the changes,
the review is at the same time a learning, growing, and communication
experience.</li>
<li>Try to observe good things from other team members and feel free to comment
and let others know about how you think that things can be improved.</li>
<li>Ideally you will have many small merge requests, because the bigger they
get, the more costly they are - now and in the future.</li>
<li>One merge request should do one thing only.</li>
<li>The target for a small request is no more than 400 touched lines
(added + removed).</li>
<li>When you do a refactoring and you need to rename something in many files,
do it in a dedicated branch which only deals with the renaming.
This will help a lot with the review. Land your changed with the ugly
names and then do a follow-up branch for the renaming.</li>
<li>Feel free to submit as many merge request as you can. There is a problem
with the size of a merge request, not with their number :).</li>
<li>Some reasons for keeping the merge requests small:<ul>
<li>Large changes are much more likely to do many things.</li>
<li>It's harder to understand them.</li>
<li>It's harder to review them.</li>
<li>It's harder to inspect the main branch to find the merge that
introduced a bug.</li>
<li>It's more likely to break the build.</li>
<li>It's harder to cherry pick code for backporting / supporting old releases.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">For person requesting a review</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Once a task/ticket is done, it should be submitted for review.</li>
<li><strong>All</strong> changes should be reviewed prior to be merged or released.</li>
<li>Before requesting a review you should run a full test on your local
computer and on all supported platforms.
Just run <tt class="docutils literal">paver test_remote all</tt> and Buildbot and GitHub will work
together to display the results.</li>
<li>Before passing the review to others, take another careful look at your work
and perform a first review yourself.
Check that all changes are described together with their attached test
cases.
It is very important to have a good review request message as it will
help reviewers understand what you have done.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Reviewer's check list</strong> since those are the things that a
reviewer will check for sure.</li>
<li>For Trac: A review request is created by adding the comment and then
setting the state to 'needs_review'.
(<strong>don't use keywords</strong>, we are using a strict ticket
work-flow so use the ticket action form).</li>
<li>For GitHub: A review request is created using <strong>GitHub Pull requests</strong>.</li>
<li>When submitting a review for changes not planed in the current milestone,
update the milestone to the current one. Don't leave the old milestone.</li>
<li>You can start writing your review request as soon as you start coding on a
branch. There is no need to wait for feature to be fully implemented and
tests to pass.
Writing a review request early, will help you to organize and explain
the work that you plan to do on the branch.</li>
<li>When the review is ready to be sent to reviewers, leave a comment
containing the <strong>needs-review</strong> marker word. It will trigger the review
request process.</li>
<li>GitHub inline comments are great, and you can add them to help with the
initial review request. Just <strong>don't abuse them</strong>!
Think twice before adding an initial inline comment for the review.
Ask yourself why that comments is needed and why that line is not
clear. Maybe adding a comment in the code would avoid the
need for the GitHub inline comment.</li>
<li>During a review, the reviewer might request changes. You can solve
the request by either changing the code, or adding a comment with
the reason why you don't want to change the code. After all requests
are solved, leave a <strong>new</strong>, separate, comment containing the keyword
<strong>needs-review</strong> . This will let reviewers know that you are done and that
they can check the latest changes.</li>
<li>Make sure that review request message is always up to date with latest
changes.
If during the review new changes are made or new test cases are discovered,
don't forget to update the initial review request message to include a
summary of these changes.</li>
<li>The &quot;How to test the changes&quot; section should include <strong>ALL</strong> test cases
done during the review. If a reviewer is following a test case not described
in the initial request message, it should update the review message with
the new test case.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="review-request-message">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Review request message</a></h3>
<p>When submitting a ticket for review, the review request should contain the
following message as described in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chevah/styleguide/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE">PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">For GitHub review requests, <strong>add the merge commit message as the pull
request title</strong>. The message should include the ticket ID number.
Example of merge commit message:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[#1234] What was done in this branch.
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The commit message should be on a single line and preferable under 100
characters. The message should be a clearly articulated phrase, summarizing
changes done in the branch. Further details about the changes can go in
the release notes or review request body.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add the list of persons who should review the branch, using a
line starting with <strong>reviewers</strong> and followed by GitHub names or each
reviewer prefixed with <strong>&#64;</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If required, using <strong>depends-on</strong> marker, add the list of reviews on which
this review depends and blocks the merge of this branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merge-your-branch">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Merge your branch</a></h3>
<p>After the merge request and review was approved you need to merge your branch
into master.</p>
<p>After your review request was approved, you can send your branch to PQM
for automatic testing and merging. Use the following command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
paver pqm GITHUB_PULL_REQUEST_ID
</pre>
<p>The PQM will check your branch and if it passed all tests, it will be merged
and pushed to master.</p>
<p>If PQM is not enabled for the repo, you will need to do a manual merge.</p>
<p>When doing manual merge using git, use squash merge and don't use the
default commit message. Here is a sample command for merging branch
&quot;1234-what-was-done&quot;:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git checkout master
git merge --no-commit --squash 1234-what-was-done
git commit -a -m &quot;[#1234] What was done in this branch.&quot;
</pre>
<p>It is recommended to define a git alias for <cite>merge --no-commit --squash</cite>.</p>
<p>A merge commit should have a commit message, in the format:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[#1234] What was done in this branch.
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>#1234</strong> is the ticket number for this branch. It is used to get more
details about branch work and review. It can also be used to associate a
commit to a ticket / branch / review / task and check the history/story of
that commit.</li>

<div class="section" id="for-person-reviewing-changes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">For person reviewing changes</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Aim for a code inspection rate of fewer than 300 – 500 LOC per hour. This
does not apply to QA team members for which, reviewing changes is the main
activity.</li>
<li>Take enough time for a proper, slow review, but not more than 60–90 minutes.
Take a big break between reviews.</li>
<li>You should always spend at least five minutes reviewing code, even if it's
just one line. Often, a single line or small changes can have major
impact throughout the whole system, and it's worth the five minutes to
think through the possible effects that a change could have.</li>
<li>The only quality metric of good work / code is <strong>WTF/s</strong>. While doing
the review you are encouraged to keep track of all your first
contact / view / read impressions and report them in the review feedback.</li>
<li>Follow procedure recommended in the &quot;How to try and test the changes&quot;
section, record environment, steps and results and share them through
a comment.</li>
<li>In case of errors, leave a comment describing what tests were run, the
exact steps you took and the actual results.</li>
<li>If the work is good, you can request the code to be merged by the author
by setting the state to needs_merge in Trac.</li>
<li>If the work is good and GitHub pull request was used, leave a comment on
the pull request page with a line starting with / containing
<strong>changes-approved</strong>.</li>
<li>If no merge is required you can close the ticket as solved.</li>
<li>If minor changes are required, and they are easy to fix, you cat try to fix
them. Commit the changes and approve the review at your revision.</li>
<li>If changes are required, you put the ticket in the <strong>needs-changes</strong> state
and assign the ticket to the person who can make the required changes.
When working with GitHub you can request changed by adding
the <strong>needs-changes</strong> marker word in a comment.</li>
<li>Don't spend to much time on a review request if it is not clear enough and
you don't know exactly what to do and how to test.
This is a problem with the review request and it <cite>needs changes</cite>.</li>

<div class="section" id="reviewer-s-check-list">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Reviewer's check list</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Does the <strong>new</strong> changes comply with latest styleguide ?</li>
<li>Does the code have tests for new code?</li>
<li>Does the merge commit message describes what is done by this branch?</li>

<li>If there is no <tt class="docutils literal">paver test_remote all</tt> for the latest code, you can
